This repository stores the code and experimental results for the comparison of RENT feature selection with BIC hyperparameter search [1] and the stability selection method [2] implemented in the stabs package in R [3]. Both methods perform ensemble feature selection based on generalized linear models with regularization. The experimental comparison is done on two datasets, denoted as c0 (synthetic dataset generated using scikit-learn method make_classification) and c3 (Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset [4]) following the naming convention in [5]. The deployed metrics include (a) predictive performance (F1, Matthews correlation coefficient), (b) selection stability and (c) runtime.

Our work contains 4 Jupyter notebooks: two for each dataset (c0 and c3, respectively), where the file with suffix "python" calls RENT and the file with suffix "R" calls stability selection. While RENT performs hyperparameter selection by minimizing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), see BIC_hyperparameter_search.py, stability selection applies hyperparameter selection via grid search on validation data, see stabsel_gridsearch.R. Predictive performances are calculated by training an unregularized GLM after feature selection.
